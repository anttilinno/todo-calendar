# Todo Calendar

## What This Is

A terminal-based (TUI) application that combines a monthly calendar view with a todo list. The left panel shows a navigable calendar with national holidays highlighted in red. The right panel displays todos for the visible month alongside undated (floating) items. Built with Go and Bubble Tea for personal use.

## Core Value

See your month at a glance — calendar with holidays and todos in one terminal screen.

## Requirements

### Validated

- Monthly calendar view (left panel) resembling `cal` output — v1.0
- Navigate between months (next/prev) — v1.0
- National holidays highlighted in red on calendar — v1.0
- Configurable country for holidays (11 countries supported) — v1.0
- Todo list (right panel) showing month's date-bound todos + floating todos — v1.0
- Add todo with optional date — v1.0
- Check off (complete) a todo — v1.0
- Delete a todo — v1.0
- Persist todos to a local JSON file on disk — v1.0
- Split-pane TUI layout (calendar left, todos right) — v1.0
- Keyboard navigation with vim keys and Tab focus switching — v1.0
- Context-sensitive help bar — v1.0
- Responsive terminal resize handling — v1.0
- TOML configuration file — v1.0
- XDG-compliant data paths — v1.0

### Active

(None — v1 complete. See v2 candidates below.)

### v2 Candidates

- Edit todo text and date after creation
- Reorder todos (move up/down)
- Todo indicators (dots/counts) on calendar dates
- Color themes / customization
- Configurable first day of week (Monday vs Sunday)
- Weekly calendar view
- Simple recurring todos
- Search/filter todos

### Out of Scope

- Individual day selection / day-by-day arrow navigation — month-level navigation is sufficient
- Syncing / cloud storage — local file only
- Priority levels or tags — keep it minimal
- CalDAV integration — complexity explosion
- Subtasks / nesting — flat list is sufficient
- Notifications / reminders — out of scope for TUI
- Time-blocked appointments — this is a todo app, not a scheduler

## Context

- **Stack:** Go 1.25.6, Bubble Tea v1.3.10, Lipgloss v1.1.0, Bubbles v0.21.1
- **Holidays:** rickar/cal/v2 with 11-country registry (de, dk, ee, es, fi, fr, gb, it, no, se, us)
- **Config:** TOML at ~/.config/todo-calendar/config.toml (BurntSushi/toml v1.6.0)
- **Storage:** JSON at ~/.config/todo-calendar/todos.json with atomic writes
- **Codebase:** 1,325 lines of Go across 17 source files
- **Architecture:** Elm Architecture (Bubble Tea), pure rendering functions, constructor DI

## Constraints

- **Stack**: Go + Bubble Tea — chosen for ergonomic component model and ecosystem
- **Storage**: Local file only — no database, no network dependencies
- **Holidays**: Must work offline using bundled Go library, not an external API

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Go + Bubble Tea over Rust + Ratatui | Better component model for split-pane layout, gentler learning curve | ✓ Good — clean architecture, fast development |
| Month-level navigation, no day selection | User doesn't have many items — showing all month todos is simpler | ✓ Good — keeps UI simple |
| Local JSON file over SQLite | Simpler, more portable, sufficient for personal use | ✓ Good — atomic writes keep data safe |
| Configurable country holidays via Go library | Offline, no API dependency, flexible | ✓ Good — 11 countries supported |
| String dates (YYYY-MM-DD) over time.Time | Prevents timezone corruption during JSON round-trips | ✓ Good — research-informed decision |
| Atomic file writes (CreateTemp+Sync+Rename) | Data safety from day one | ✓ Good — prevents corruption |
| Pure rendering functions | RenderGrid has no side effects, testable | ✓ Good — clean separation |
| Three-mode input state machine | Cleanly separates key handling for normal/text/date | ✓ Good — input isolation works well |

## Known Tech Debt

- Store.Save() errors ignored in CRUD methods (silent persistence failures on disk errors)

**Defined:** 2026-02-12
**Core Value:** See your month at a glance — calendar with holidays and todos in one terminal screen

## v2.0 Requirements

Requirements for v2.0 Settings UX milestone.

### Settings

- [ ] **SET-01**: User can close settings overlay with Esc and all changes are saved

## Future Requirements

### Recurring

- **REC-01**: Complex recurring cadences ("every 2nd Tuesday", "last Friday of month")

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Per-field undo in settings | Over-engineering for small config surface |
| Settings import/export | Local-only app, single config file |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| SET-01 | Phase 30 | Pending |
| SET-02 | Phase 30 | Pending |

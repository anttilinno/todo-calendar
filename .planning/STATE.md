## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for complete log.

Recent decisions from research:
- Priority is visual-only (no auto-sort) to preserve manual J/K reordering
- Map priority colors to existing theme palette where possible (P1=red, P2=orange, P3=blue, P4=grey)
- Natural language dates dropped from v2.1 — deferred to future

Phase 31 decisions:
- Priority 0 = no priority, 1-4 = valid priority levels
- Callers pass priority 0 as placeholder until Phase 32 wires actual priority from edit form

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.

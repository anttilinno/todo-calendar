# Milestone v1.1: Polish & Personalization

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-05
**Phases:** 4-6
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

Make the calendar more informative at a glance and let users customize the experience.

## Phases

### Phase 4: Calendar Enhancements
**Goal**: Users see at a glance which dates have pending work, and can configure their preferred week layout
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (existing calendar grid and todo store)
**Requirements**: INDI-01, INDI-02, INDI-03, FDOW-01, FDOW-02, FDOW-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Calendar dates with incomplete todos display bracket indicators `[N]` around the date number
  2. Dates with only completed todos render identically to dates with no todos (no indicator)
  3. Calendar grid columns and rows remain properly aligned when indicators are present alongside non-indicated dates
  4. User can set `first_day_of_week = "monday"` or `"sunday"` in config.toml and the calendar grid starts on that day
  5. Day-of-week header row (Mo Tu We...) reflects the configured start day
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md -- Config migration, store query method, and grid rendering overhaul
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md -- Wire indicators through calendar model and update app layout

### Phase 5: Todo Editing
**Goal**: Users can modify todos after creation without deleting and re-adding
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (existing todo CRUD and input system)
**Requirements**: EDIT-01, EDIT-02, EDIT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can press `e` on a selected todo to enter edit mode with existing text pre-filled, modify the text, and confirm
  2. User can change a todo's date -- adding a date to a floating todo, changing an existing date, or removing a date to make it floating
  3. Edited todos are persisted to disk immediately after confirmation (surviving app restart)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md -- Store Update/Find methods and edit key bindings
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md -- Edit text and edit date mode handlers

### Phase 6: Themes
**Goal**: Users can personalize the app's appearance by choosing a color theme
**Depends on**: Phases 4-5 (all UI elements exist to be themed)
**Requirements**: THME-01, THME-02, THME-03, THME-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. App ships with 4 distinct preset themes: Dark, Light, Nord, and Solarized
  2. User can set `theme = "dark"` (or light, nord, solarized) in config.toml and the app renders with that theme on next launch
  3. All UI elements -- borders, panel backgrounds, calendar highlights, holiday text, todo text, help bar, date indicators -- render in colors consistent with the selected theme
  4. When no theme is configured in config.toml, the app defaults to the Dark theme
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md -- Theme struct with 4 preset palettes and config field
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md -- Wire theme through all styles, models, and help bar

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Config field changed from `monday_start` bool to `first_day_of_week` string
- Calendar grid widened from 20 to 34 chars (4-char cells)
- Indicators refresh on every Update cycle for simplicity
- Empty text rejected on edit confirm; empty date accepted (convert to floating)
- 14 semantic color fields named by role, not component
- Empty string means terminal default (Dark theme respects user palette)
- Styles struct + constructor pattern replaces package-level vars

**Issues Resolved:**
None -- all phases executed without issues.

**Issues Deferred:**
None.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None.

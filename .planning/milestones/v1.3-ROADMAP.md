## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Always show both pending and completed counts (including zeros) for visual consistency
- Dedicated PendingFg/CompletedCountFg theme roles instead of reusing HolidayFg/IndicatorFg
- FormatDate/ParseUserDate in config package (co-located with DateLayout/DatePlaceholder)
- Date input adapts to display format (3 presets use unique separators, no ambiguity)
- weekStart tracks first day of displayed week; m.year/m.month updated to match for seamless todolist sync
- Keys() returns mode-aware copies of key bindings rather than mutating stored keys
- Inline filter applies to both dated and floating sections; headers always visible with "(no matches)" placeholder
- Floating todos show "No date" in search; Enter on them closes overlay (no month to jump to)
- Search results sorted: dated first by date ascending, then floating by ID
- Search overlay creates fresh model on each Ctrl+F press (no stale state)

**Issues Resolved:**
- None — all phases executed without issues

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None — clean execution across all phases

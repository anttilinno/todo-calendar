# Requirements: Todo Calendar

**Defined:** 2026-02-08
**Core Value:** See your month at a glance — calendar with holidays and todos in one terminal screen

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for v1.8 milestone.

### Weekly View Filtering

- [x] **WKLY-01**: In weekly view, todo panel displays only todos dated within the currently visible week
- [x] **WKLY-02**: Floating (undated) todos remain visible in weekly view regardless of selected week
- [x] **WKLY-03**: Todo panel updates immediately when user navigates weeks using h/l keys

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release.

### Advanced Recurring

- **RECUR-01**: Complex recurring cadences ("every 2nd Tuesday", "last Friday of month")

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Monthly view todo filtering | Monthly view should continue showing all month todos — established behavior |
| Week number display | Not needed for core weekly filtering feature |
| Multi-week view | Single week focus is sufficient |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| WKLY-01 | Phase 26 | Complete |
| WKLY-02 | Phase 26 | Complete |
| WKLY-03 | Phase 26 | Complete |

# Milestone v1.8: Weekly Todo Filtering

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-08
**Phases:** 26
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

Weekly view now filters todo panel to show only that week's dated todos plus floating items, with instant updates on navigation. Users can focus on the current week's tasks without seeing the entire month's backlog.

## Phases

### Phase 26: Weekly Todo Filtering

**Goal**: Users see only the current week's todos (plus floating items) when in weekly view, with instant updates on navigation
**Depends on**: Nothing (standalone feature on existing weekly view)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 26-01: Add date-range store query, calendar getter, todolist week filter, and app wiring

**Success Criteria:**
1. When user presses `w` to enter weekly view, the todo panel shows only todos dated within that week's Monday-Sunday (or Sunday-Saturday per config) range
2. Undated (floating) todos remain visible in the todo panel regardless of which week is selected
3. When user presses `h`/`l` to navigate to a different week, the todo panel immediately updates to show only that week's dated todos
4. When user presses `w` again to return to monthly view, the todo panel reverts to showing all todos for the full month

**Details:**
- TodosForDateRange method added to TodoStore interface
- SQLite implementation follows TodosForMonth pattern with date range parameters
- Calendar WeekStart() getter exposes week boundary for app model
- Todolist model has weekFilterStart/End fields with SetWeekFilter/ClearWeekFilter methods
- visibleItems() conditionally uses date-range query when week filter active
- syncTodoView() in app model centralizes view-mode detection and filter management

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Week filter uses ISO date strings to match existing store patterns (not time.Time)
- syncTodoView centralizes view-mode logic instead of duplicating conditionals at each call site
- Search jump explicitly clears week filter since it navigates by month
- Nord/Solarized MutedFg/EmptyFg use lighter colors (nord9, base00) for better contrast

**Issues Resolved:**
- Weekly view now shows focused, relevant todo list
- Empty state messages "(no todos this week)" clearly visible in all themes
- Dates, hints, and separators have improved contrast in Nord and Solarized

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None

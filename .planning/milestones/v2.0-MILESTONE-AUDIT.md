# Milestone Audit: v2.0 Settings UX

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SET-01: Esc saves and closes | 30 | Satisfied | SettingChangedMsg on every cycle, CloseMsg on Esc |
| SET-02: No save button or cancel | 30 | Satisfied | Save/Cancel keys removed, footer shows "esc close" |

**Score: 2/2 requirements satisfied**

## Phase Verification

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 30: Save-on-Close Settings | Complete | Implemented directly (no GSD phase artifacts) |

## Integration Check

Not applicable — standalone UX change within settings package. No cross-phase wiring.

## E2E Flows

Settings flow verified:
1. User presses `s` → settings overlay opens
2. User navigates with j/k, cycles values with h/l
3. Each value change immediately saves to config.toml and applies (theme, country, etc.)
4. User presses Esc → overlay closes
5. No revert/cancel behavior — all changes already persisted

## Tech Debt

None.

## Verdict

**PASSED** — All requirements met. No gaps. No tech debt.

## Current Test

number: done
name: all tests complete
awaiting: none

## Tests

### 1. Todo item spacing and separators
expected: Todo items have blank-line spacing between them. Section headers have a thin separator line (──────────) underneath. Items are visually distinct and easy to scan.
result: PASS (fixed: removed extra blank lines between items, made separator match header width)

### 2. Styled checkboxes
expected: Unchecked items show [ ] in accent color. Checked items show [x] in green. Completed todo text has strikethrough but the checkbox itself does not.
result: PASS

### 3. Help bar — normal mode (short)
expected: In normal mode with todo pane focused, the help bar shows approximately 5 key bindings (a/add, x/done, d/delete, e/edit, //filter) plus ? for more. NOT the full list of 15+ bindings.
result: PASS (fixed: only show pane keys + ? in short mode, global keys in expanded only)

### 4. Help bar — expanded via ?
expected: Pressing ? expands the help bar to show all keybindings in a multi-line columnar layout. The content area shrinks to accommodate. Pressing ? again collapses back to short mode.
result: PASS (fixed: q now closes help instead of quitting)

### 5. Help bar — input mode
expected: When in any input mode (e.g., press 'a' to add), the help bar shows only Enter/Esc (and Tab if in dated-add mode). Not the full keybinding list.
result: PASS

### 6. Full-pane add todo (single field)
expected: Pressing 'a' replaces the todo list with a centered form showing "Add Todo" heading, "Title" label, text input field, and "Enter confirm | Esc cancel" hint. The todo list is hidden.
result: PASS

### 7. Full-pane add dated todo (dual field)
expected: Pressing 'A' shows a form with both "Title" and "Date" fields visible simultaneously. Title is focused first. Help shows "Enter confirm | Esc cancel | Tab switch field".
result: PASS (fixed: removed duplicate in-form hint)

### 8. Tab field switching in dated add
expected: While in dated-add mode ('A'), pressing Tab moves cursor focus from Title to Date field (and back). Both fields remain visible. Text typed in each field is preserved when switching.
result: PASS

### 9. Full-pane edit existing todo
expected: Selecting a todo and pressing 'e' shows a full-pane "Edit Todo" form with the current title pre-filled in the text field. Cursor is at end of text. Enter saves, Esc cancels.
result: PASS

### 10. Full-pane edit date
expected: Selecting a dated todo and pressing 'E' shows a full-pane form with the current date pre-filled. Can clear to make floating, or type a new date.
result: PASS

### 11. Pre-built templates available
expected: On a fresh database (or existing one after upgrade), pressing 't' to use a template shows 7 templates: Meeting Notes, Checklist, Daily Plan, Bug Report, Feature Spec, PR Checklist, Code Review.
result: PASS

### 12. Template placeholder prompting
expected: Selecting a template with placeholders (e.g., "Meeting Notes") prompts for each placeholder value (Topic, Date) before creating the todo.
result: PASS

### 13. Template deletion
expected: Deleting a pre-built template (via template management) permanently removes it. It does not reappear after restarting the app.
result: SKIPPED (no template deletion UI exists — only create and use)

## Summary
